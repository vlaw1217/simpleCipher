# simpleCipher
Use any programming language to programme your cipher based on part 1 design.   Provide a frontend interface for your professor to validate the design with clear instructions (like the length of the input message and key).

Expectation:
User enter the message with the key of his/her choice, your cipher will convert them to ciphertext.
User cut and paste the ciphertext to your decryption session and input the same “key”, the original message is decrypted and is the same as what the user enters in the encryption session.
